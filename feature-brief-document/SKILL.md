# Feature Brief document

Shape owns one Feature Brief for each substantial feature. The brief records
useful behavioural understanding that survives discussion. It is working memory
while Draft and the behavioural contract from Ready onward. Writing the
brief does not drive the discussion. Design may correct non-material wording
or links, with those changes included in Design acceptance. Material changes
return to Shape through the status rules below.

## Create and locate

Create a brief when Shape has enough useful behavioural understanding to
preserve. Do not create one merely because Shape has started. Keep material
agreements and open questions in the brief rather than separate Shape notes,
context dumps, or handoff documents.

Require an existing Backlog item with `Status: Ready for Shape`. If no item
exists, return the work to Direction. If its status is `Needs Direction`, return
to the unresolved question in Direction. Return any other status besides `Ready
for Shape` to Direction for review. Do not create or promote an item from this
skill.

If a prerequisite requires a Direction decision, explain the missing decision
and recommend a next step there. Ask the user to approve or change that step.
Keep brief creation blocked until the Backlog item is Ready for Shape.

Read the Ready item, nearby briefs, and applicable main or topic Direction,
Context, PDR, and ADR material. Use the item's stable ID as the feature ID.
Store the brief at `.workflow/features/<feature-id>/brief.md`, such as
`.workflow/features/B-0001/brief.md`. Link it from the Backlog item through
`backlog-document`.

Before creating the file, check whether a brief for the feature exists elsewhere.
Do not create a duplicate or migrate it in this skill. If a migration is needed,
present the found path and required canonical destination. Recommend a separate
migration to keep one authoritative Feature Brief. Ask the user to approve
starting it or request changes. Keep this brief operation blocked until the
migration is complete.

## Structure

Use this structure as the brief gains content. A Draft can have empty or
incomplete sections. Omit optional sections when they add no value:

```markdown
# Feature title

Status: Draft
Feature ID: B-0001

## Goal

## Stories and acceptance

### S1: Short name

Story: Actor, situation, intent or action, and observable result.

Acceptance:

- Observable criterion.

## Feature-wide constraints and acceptance

## Scope

## Non-goals

## Related records

## Open questions and assumptions
```

## Maintenance

Keep an existing brief current with material changes to behaviour, boundaries,
agreements, and open questions. Do not rewrite it after every exploratory turn.
Mark tentative parts of a Draft clearly. Continue the Shape discussion after
an edit.

When the feature contract changes, use `backlog-document` to update affected
item boundaries and durable relationships.

## Status changes

Keep one `Status` field near the title. Use these values:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Draft | Shape in progress. |
| Ready | Shape accepted, ready for Design. |
| Designed | Design accepted. |
| Implemented | Implementation complete and checks pass. |
| Reviewed | Independent Review complete. |
| Accepted | Feature accepted as finished. |

Create a brief as Draft. Do not present a Draft brief as accepted behaviour.
Shape owns the readiness review and acceptance request. Set Ready only after
explicit user agreement.
This document skill does not start Design after approval. Ready briefs that
are not selected remain available for later work.

Design sets Designed after the user accepts the Design. Implement sets
Implemented after implementation is complete and required checks pass.
Review sets Reviewed after independent checks, specialist coverage, and the
review report are complete. Reviewed may still have findings for Acceptance.
Acceptance sets Accepted only when the agreed stories, acceptance criteria,
and applicable constraints are satisfied with sufficient evidence. It returns
unresolved intent decisions to the user. Update the same brief as each stage
completes.

If later evidence requires a material change to behaviour, scope, stories, or
acceptance criteria, return it to Shape. Propose the behaviour and explain why.
Ask the user to approve or change the proposal there. Set Draft before changing
the contract and keep the contract change blocked until Shape settles it.

## Content and acceptance

State the goal and intended value. Use stories and failure cases to test
behaviour in the discussion. Record stories and acceptance criteria as the user
and model agree on them. Each story identifies an actor, situation, intent or
action, and observable result.

Keep acceptance criteria about observable behaviour, not internal design or
test implementation. Give every Ready feature at least one user or system story. Put criteria under
each story so their trace is clear. Put criteria that span stories under a named
feature-wide constraint. Before Ready, give every story acceptance coverage.
Cover relevant failure and boundary behaviour, permissions, persistence,
lifecycle, and compatibility where observable.

State scope and non-goals. Link neighbouring features and shared Direction,
Context, PDR, or ADR material when they constrain this feature.

Record unresolved feature-behaviour questions and unverified assumptions in
Draft. Keep uncertain behaviour there until the user resolves, verifies,
removes, or safely defers it. Keep unresolved end-state questions in Direction
and link to them instead of copying them. Remove resolved questions and
superseded wording instead of retaining a discussion history.

Ready requires one coherent vertical slice, agreed behaviour and boundaries,
acceptance coverage, intentional scope and non-goals, and linked shared
decisions. Design must be able to proceed without making product decisions.
No open question may materially change the feature. A safely deferred
assumption must leave the feature contract clear.

Do not include internal APIs, modules, schemas, classes, libraries,
implementation plans, test code, copied shared rules, or speculative future
behaviour.

## Size and validation

Keep a Draft only as long as its current understanding needs. The hard limit
is 1,000 words per brief. Near that limit, remove copied decisions, history,
and implementation detail. Question whether separate features are hidden in
the brief. Split unrelated behaviour and update the Backlog relationship.

Invoke `concise-prose` before writing or revising the Feature Brief. Apply its
principles and run `prose-check` as described there. Install
`workflow-document-check` alongside this skill and run it after edits. Check
status, feature identity, and links after edits. Check story coverage, criterion
trace, and unresolved material questions when reviewing readiness.
